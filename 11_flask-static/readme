K11 - Static Pages in Flask
2024-09-26
time spent: 0.5

Predictions:
- When loading the root page, it should still display No Hablo Queso and print __main__ in terminal.
- When loading the subdirectory /static, it will run h(). It will display a random number and still print __main__ in terminal.

Observed:
- We had to load the subdirectory /static/foo.html. It does still print __main__ in terminal.
- When loading /static or /static/foo it leads to 404 server not found.
