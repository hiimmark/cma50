K11 - Static Pages in Flask
2024-09-26
time spent: 0.5

Predictions:
- When loading the root page, it should still display No Hablo Queso and print __main__ in terminal.
- Before uncommenting the code in app.py, the text "Is this plaintext, though?"
will be displayed since it is what is in the /static/foo.html file locally.
- After the uncomment, h() will be run. It will display a random number in /static/foo.html and still print __main__ in terminal.

Observed:
- /static/foo returns a 404 error
- /static/foo.html displays "Is this plaintext, though?"
Once uncommented the code from app.py...
- We had to load the subdirectory /static/foo.html. It does still print __main__ in terminal.
- When loading /static or /static/foo it leads to 404 server not found.
