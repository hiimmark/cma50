**DISCO:**

*Bootstrap*: the phrases/words used to added a specific component with CSS are very easy to understand and allow for more effective code.
- the alerts can be useful for user info when user doesn't meet a specific criteria, makes it easier to do without javascript
- dropdown feature is very builtin, and typically there would be a lot of code used to dispaly a dropdown, so this makes it much moe efficient.
- Is there a default setting for styling in bootstrap for text font/size/color/etc.

*Foundations:*
- focuses more on structure and less on jumbling a lot of code into one simple feature.
- not very efficent
- we dont like it.

*Tailwind*: This framework focuses more on the stylistic components of the website rather than structure. However, for Foundations, there is less of a focus on style and more on structure. It seems like it is used more for adding specific/particular aspects like a name card div boxes. For tailwind, all style components.

**QCC:**
1. Why does Foundations framework still use a css file if it is for styling? Are there more specific, effective ways to add color, size, etc throuhg tailwind rather than focusing on structure.
2. Is used the CDN different than importing/downloading it anyhow?
3. Bootstrap:  How does athe grid/layout system work? Is it simialr to foundations?

We used other external resources to better understand our peers' code. There were some phrases/words/classes we didn't understand in its purpose which looking at geekforgeek links helped to understand. We also looked up things on foundations and particularly why it still uses css files with a lot of stylistic elements that could (perhaps) be done through the framework. We also tried to understand how different using the classes/phrases in Foundations would be different from manually writing it.
